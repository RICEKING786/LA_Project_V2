            <p>Extreme poverty. Lots of people think they know what it is, but the people that are not in extreme poverty don't know exactly what it is. Extreme poverty is something that so many people in the world are going through today and the past 100 years and it is one of the main UN Sustainable development goals. The UN goal 1, which is the No Poverty goal, is to be achieved by the year of 2030. The UN Goal is very ambitious and it is not going to be achieved unless something changes over the next few years. The pandemic is very bad for the UN goal of No Poverty, but the goal was not going to be fulfilled before the pandemic either. We were on track to still have 6% of extreme poverty in the world by 2030, which is not good at all. People are in this cycle of extreme poverty and it is very hard for them to get out of this cycle without any help from other who are more well-established. In the following blog posts, I will show you how people are keep on going in a cycle, why specific countries have so many people in this cycle, and how China has done specific things along with help from other people, organizations, and companies, to take the people out of this cycle.</p>
